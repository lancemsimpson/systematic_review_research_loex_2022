# Systematic Review Research Loex 2022

By: Lance Simpson, Research and Instructional Services Librarian, Rodgers Library for Science and Engineering, The University of Alabama

This software was created for use in [LOEX 2022](http://www.loexconference.org/) presentation, *Building a Systematic Review Instruction & Research Support Program: An Instructional Framework*, by Karleigh Riesen, Alex Boucher, and Lance Simpson. 

We conducted all searches in various [Scopus APIs](https://dev.elsevier.com/tecdoc_ir_cris_vivo.html) using [Pybliometrics Wrappers](https://pybliometrics.readthedocs.io/en/stable/#). Search strategies were derived from [UA Libraries's Scholarly API Cookbook: Scopus API in Python](https://ualibweb.github.io/UALIB_ScholarlyAPI_Cookbook/content/scripts/python/python_scopus.html).

For this project, we used [Jupyter Lab](https://jupyter.org/) to both conduct the searches, and create the slides. Links for the code and for a slide deck of the presetnation can be found below in the `repository directory`.
